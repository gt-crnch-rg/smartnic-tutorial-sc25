**Abstract:** The past few years have witnessed an increased level of support for and deployment of programmable network adapters, known as "SmartNICs." These enhanced network devices offer standard packet processing capabilities as well as advanced "in-network" computing features built around programmable lightweight processing cores, FPGAs, and even CPU- and GPU-based platforms capable of running separate operating systems. SmartNICs have gained rapid adoption for data center tasks, including infrastructure management, packet filtering, and I/O acceleration. Increasingly, these devices are also being explored for high performance computing (HPC) and AI application acceleration. This tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of the state of the art for SmartNICs and the emerging software ecosystems supporting them. Attendees will engage in hands-on exercises to better understand how to take advantage of SmartNICs for accelerating HPC and AI applications. Specific topics include MPI and OpenMP offloading, algorithmic modifications to utilize SmartNIC processors, in-line packet processing frameworks like P4, security and containerization efforts, and I/O acceleration techniques. Participants will have the opportunity to execute these exercises using cutting-edge SmartNICs like NVIDIA’s BlueField-3 data processing unit (DPU) and a cloud-based netlab environment. Tutorial presenters will discuss additional techniques for optimizing applications to harness SmartNICs as communication accelerators in HPC systems.
